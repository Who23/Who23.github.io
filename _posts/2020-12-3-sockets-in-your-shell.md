Something I learned recently and I thought was *amazing* - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldn't find anything for fish.

Here's how it works:

## bash
Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in `/dev`. Enter
```bash
$ echo "text!" > /dev/$PROTO/$HOST/$PORT
```
And you'll create a connection to `HOST:PORT`. `$PROTO` can be `tcp` or `udp`. If the connection can't be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.

Along with being easy to access from the terminal, it's *very* handy for scripts, especially if you don't have `nc`/`telnet`. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if it's running with:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ exec 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null 3>/dev/tcp/localhost/8000 ] ; then
	echo "server up!"
else
	echo "server down."
fi
```
And then use that information somewhere else. 

If you're unfamiliar, `exec` is used here to create the file to write to (>), with file descriptor 3 referring to it and thus the connection. 

We can use `exec` to create a connection we can read *and* write to with `<>`, and create a super simple curl:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/"$1"/80
echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\n" >&3
cat <&3
```
```
$ ./simplecurl www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

I'm sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!

## zsh
zsh has an external module you can load in order to use it's socket capabilities. It doesn't support udp like bash, but it's more powerful in a few ways!

To load the module, put the following in your `.zshrc` or run it in your shell:
```
$ zmodload zsh/net/tcp
```

We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - `ztcp`! 

`ztcp` allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.

Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with `ztcp`:

```bash
# host machine:
ztcp -l 7128
lfd=$REPLY
ztcp -a $lfd
talkfd=$REPLY

# client machine
ztcp HOST 7128
talkfd=$REPLY
```

The `$REPLY` variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last `ztcp` command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.

So, `talkfd` on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:
```bash
# host machine
echo -e "hello!" >&$talkfd

# client machine
read -r line <&$talkfd; print -r - $line
> hello!
```

Again, there's a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.

Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!
